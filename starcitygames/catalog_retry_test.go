// TestLoadCatalogRetryStartsClean drives the singles scraper through a catalog
// export that breaks partway and is read again from the top. The pieces are
// each covered on their own - the client's replay, the bucket decision,
// reset() itself - but nothing covered the scraper wired to the replay, so a
// stream callback that dropped the reset left the abandoned pass's records in
// place and every one of them arrived a second time. The quantities survive
// that (a record identical to itself is refused rather than doubled), so it is
// what the run says that gives it away: the replay must have nothing to report
// about the records it re-reads.
//
// The export carries the Armory Deck pair, so the run that follows the break
// has to end up with one card holding the pair's copies once, and with the
// listing on record as a pair exactly once.
