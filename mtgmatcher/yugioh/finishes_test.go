// for the uuid pricing it. Each has to answer with the entry stamped with
// that run, no two runs of a printing and no two printings may answer with
// one uuid, and every stored entry has to be some printing's run - a run
// silently overwritten in FoilUUIDs would leave a uuid nothing can reach.
// The shared names stay refused throughout: they are the flag slots aimed
// at the default run, and answering one with a run would hand a bare foil
// flag a printing nobody asked for.
