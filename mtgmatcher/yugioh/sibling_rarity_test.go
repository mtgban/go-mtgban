// TestSiblingRarity pins the edition a tier names when the number does not.
// A set family splits into editions filed as sets of their own, each printing
// the same cards under its own numbers - MVP1-EN054, MVP1-ENG54, MVP1-ENS54 -
// and a storefront that numbers every one of them with the base edition's
// number has said which tier and never which edition. All three answered with
// the base edition's Ultra, so the $2.50 Gold and the $1.50 Secret were both
// sold at the $1.25 Ultra's price.
