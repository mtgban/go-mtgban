// TestPossessiveRarity pins the three ways a storefront writes a tier the
// catalog spells possessively. Dropping the possessive is not a near miss:
// every tier this game has ends in "Rare", so a wording the premium tier
// cannot answer is still answered in full by the plain one, and King's
// Court sells both at one number - the listing that says "Collector Rare"
// was being handed the printing worth a fortieth of it.
