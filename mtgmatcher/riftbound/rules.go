// promo tier reaches; and the organized-play promos pair a Best Of foil with
// a Prize Wall nonfoil under one number, typed so differently that a plain
// variation describes neither.

// Running last and only on a tie costs no printing: a finish no candidate
// carries leaves the list alone, so the roughly half of the game sold in a
// single finish still answers a storefront that reports the flag wrongly, or
// does not report it at all.
