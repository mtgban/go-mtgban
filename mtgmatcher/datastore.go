// A datastore entry's id is opaque. The builder that publishes it spells it,
// and no loader here reads one apart: what an id could be taken apart for -
// which product an entry belongs to, which printing of that product it is -
// every datastore publishes as a field of its own, so a loader asks for the
// fact instead of inferring it from a shape.
//
// This is not a style preference. A loader recovering an entry's product by
// trimming a literal tail off its id breaks as soon as a builder spells that
// tail from the printing's own name - "_holo" as "_holofoil", "_1e" as
// "_1stedition": the trimming stops matching and printings of one product
// become separate cards. Nothing throws, since the ids stay well formed, unique
// and stable. A grouping read off a published field
// cannot fail that way, and it leaves the builder free to respell an id, or
// to stop spelling it out of anything at all.
