// Package onepiece loads a One Piece Card Game datastore.
//
// The datastore is built by github.com/mtgban/datastore-gen's cmd/onepiece
// from the TCGplayer catalog dump for category 68, annotated with
// punk-records' mirror of the official Bandai card list. Identity is the
// catalog's: every entry is one priced printing of an English single
// product, so every uuid is priced by construction. Most products sell in
// a single finish, but the few sold both plain and foil carry one entry
// per finish, the foil one's id suffixed "_foil". Alternate arts,
// parallels and event printings share their base card's collector number
// and are told apart by the variant label the builder distills from the
// product name.
