// The scraper can price by name where the bridge is missing, and that is the
// weaker answer, not the same one: the bridge settles a product by an id both
// catalogs carry, while a name reaches about half of what each datastore holds
// and reaches it on a spelling. A run that quietly delivered the weaker answer
// would be a run nobody was told about, so the failure is loud instead -
// scraperResources returning an error ends the run.
