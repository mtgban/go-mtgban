# coolstuffinc

Prices Cool Stuff Inc's singles and sealed product, buy and sell, across
eight games: Magic, Lorcana, Riftbound, Yu-Gi-Oh, One Piece, Pokemon,
Gundam, Palworld. Wired into `cmd/bantool` as fourteen scrapers — one
singles scraper per game (`coolstuffinc`, `coolstuffinc_gundam`,
`coolstuffinc_lorcana`, `coolstuffinc_onepiece`, `coolstuffinc_palworld`,
`coolstuffinc_pokemon`, `coolstuffinc_riftbound`, `coolstuffinc_yugioh`)
via `NewScraper(game)`, plus one sealed scraper for six of those eight
(`coolstuffinc_sealed*`, everything but Gundam and Palworld) via
`NewScraperSealed(game)`. No Flesh and Blood shelf exists here — that is
Star City Games' territory, see `starcitygames/README.md` — and no
credential is needed: the only setting is an optional affiliate id,
`CSI_PARTNER`.

## The core problem

**CSI publishes no identifier at all, for any game, on either feed.** The
buylist (`CSIPriceEntry`) carries a `PID` — CSI's own internal product id,
used only to build a debug URL — and nothing else that names a printing
independently of its wording. The retail HTML search carries not even
that: no scryfall id, no tcgplayer id, in the row markup for any game. So
every resolution, for every game, on both sides, is **wording- and
shelf-driven**: the printing is whatever `Name` + `ItemSet`/shelf +
`Variation` (built from `Notes`/`Number`) + `Foil` happens to name, and
when the shelf itself names the wrong thing, nothing catches it.

This is the opposite failure mode from Star City Games, whose problem is a
vendor id that is *present and sometimes wrong*. Here there is usually no
id to be wrong — the vendor's whole data model for a listing is prose, and
the scraper is what turns prose into an identity. That makes this package
much larger than a single defect class fixed several times; it is one
translation layer per game, independently discovered and independently
broken.

The **one** identifier-driven path in the whole package is Magic sealed
product: `NewScraperSealed` builds `productMap` from `co.Identifiers["csiId"]`
on every sealed Magic uuid the datastore carries — a field this scraper
reads but never writes, populated upstream (MTGJSON/datastore-gen). Every
other resolution, sealed or singles, any game, goes through wording.

## Data sources

Three feeds, all live.

- **Retail/singles**: an HTML search, `POST https://www.coolstuffinc.com/sq/`,
  one request per storefront "Item Set" shelf (the checkbox list at
  `csiInventoryURL`), each shelf paged. `processSearch` parses one
  `product-search-row` per card and one `offers` block per condition/price
  row inside it.
- **Buylist**: `GET .../GeneratedFiles/SellList/Section-<shelf>.json` —
  `CSIPriceEntry`, one JSON array for the whole shelf (all editions, all
  conditions, tens of thousands of rows). `LoadBuylistEditions` separately
  scrapes an HTML `<select>` for the edition-name→id map used only to build
  a debug link.
- **Sealed**: Magic sealed rides a fixed saved-query URL (`sealedURL`,
  literally `/sq/2293832`) and resolves purely by the `csiId` product-map
  above; the other five sealed-wired games (`Sealed.scrapeBysets`) instead
  run the *same* search endpoint as singles, once per sealed-product word
  ("booster", "deck", "trove", "gift", "bundle", "case", "box", "kit",
  "vault", "collection"), and resolve each hit through
  `mtgmatcher.ResolveSealed` — a card row simply fails to resolve and drops
  out. Lorcana's sealed carries no `ItemSet` facet at all, which is why the
  sealed search goes by name rather than by shelf.

A fourth, dead one used to sit here: `csiPricelistURL`
(`gateway_json.php?k=`), `CSIClient`, `NewCSIClient`, `CSICard`, and
`Preprocess(CSICard)` were a whole second retail API — keyed, unlike
everything else in this package, with a scryfall id on every row — with
zero callers anywhere in the repo. Removed outright rather than kept
around as a maybe-someday alternate path.

Deleting `Preprocess(CSICard)` did not delete its knowledge for free,
though, and that is worth knowing on its own: five of its six edition
cases named shelves CSI is still selling on today (`Black Bordered
(foreign)`, `Ikoria: Lair of Behemoths: Variants`, `Portal 3 Kingdoms`,
`Double Masters: Variants`, `Dominaria United: Variants` — confirmed
against a live fetch of the shelf checkbox list), and the live retail
path (`preprocess()`, used by `processSearch`) carries no equivalent case
for any of them. Checked live rows from all five against the real
datastore: four resolve fine anyway — the live path's generic wording
already covers what the dead function's special cases once bought it,
`Godzilla`/`Showcase Frame`/foreign-refusal included, at least in the
sense of "resolves without error," which is as far as this was checked.
`Black Bordered (foreign)` alone does not: a listing in any of the six
languages that shelf carries currently returns `ErrUnsupported` from
`preprocess()` — Italian and Japanese included, which the dead function's
own table would have routed to `FBB`/`4BB`, both real sets the datastore
carries. Nothing is mispriced by this; the listing is silently dropped
rather than priced onto the wrong card, which is presumably why nobody
noticed. Fixing it needs an answer this package doesn't have: `Edition:
"Foreign Black Border"` resolves a card correctly with no `Language` set,
and *stops* resolving it the moment `Language: "Italian"` is added — a
question for `mtgmatcher`'s own language filtering, not for this scraper.

## fetchWhole — the resume saga

The buylist download is an 18MB+ uncompressed file, and the storefront
truncates it mid-stream roughly one fetch in three: HTTP 200, a short body,
no transport error — nothing notices until the JSON decode reports an
unexpected EOF. This took four commits to get right, in order:

1. Retry the whole file on failure (original behaviour). Not enough: three
   bad attempts in a row is a ~1-in-25 event and it reddened the Pokemon
   CI job on 2026-09-09.
2. **`fetchWhole`** (#547): the response honours `Range` and states
   `Content-Length`, so ask only for the missing bytes each pass, and stop
   when the body is whole or a pass adds nothing.
3. **Stop resuming a body that stops growing** (6dcb7f68): a server that
   will not honour `Range` re-answers 200 with the whole file from byte 0
   every time, which "adds" the same truncated length forever. Track the
   *longest* body any pass has held and stop when a pass does not beat it,
   not when the latest pass alone adds nothing.
4. **Ask about the header before trusting it** (#548): `Content-Length`
   only means anything while the transport doesn't touch the body — ask
   for `identity` encoding explicitly (checked live: CSI serves this path
   uncompressed regardless of what's offered, though it gzips its PHP
   pages). A response with no length at all (`-1`, e.g. chunked) has
   nothing to resume against and must be reported as a short read, not
   silently accepted as the whole file — the old order did the latter,
   which is a truncation with **no error**, worse than the one this
   started from.

The fix works around what can be worked around: a chunked body that ends
cleanly at the wrong byte is indistinguishable from a real end of stream,
by construction.

## offerSeen — the two-shelf-twin dedupe

A card the search lists on two shelves at once (the One Piece Heroines
Edition card, filed both under its own set and a crossover promo shelf)
arrives as the same offer twice: same url, same condition, same seller.
`offerSeen`'s dedupe key used to be exactly that triple, and a product
row's *other* offers — its foil, its graded copies, its first-edition
run — are also filed at the same url and the same `NM` condition as the
plain copy. So the dedupe silently ate them as "the same offer already
seen": Magic's retail row count fell from 101,645 to 74,279 the day the
dedupe landed, Lorcana's by 40%, Riftbound's by 24% (#555). The key now
includes the **resolved card id**, not just url+condition+seller — an
offer is the printing it resolved to, at its condition, from its seller,
behind its url.

## Cross-cutting mechanics

- **The condition column is overloaded.** CSI's per-row condition text is
  sometimes a real condition ("Near Mint"), sometimes a **print run**
  ("1st Edition Holofoil" — `conditionRun`/`matchRun`, which refuses
  rather than silently pricing the run as the ordinary printing when the
  match doesn't actually carry that finish), sometimes a **printing of its
  own** ("PRE-ERRATA" — `conditionPrinting`), sometimes a **grading
  marker** ("BGS", "PSA", "Unique", "Shadowless", "No Set Symbol" —
  `isGraded`, which reroutes the row to the `Cool Stuff Inc (unique)`
  sub-seller via `MarketNames`/`availableMarketNames` rather than pricing
  it as a normal NM copy), and sometimes a **skip signal** ("Asian" —
  `isSkippedCondition`, since the one Evolving Wilds sold that way carries
  no language, set or number to resolve against). A grading service or
  print run this table doesn't know about is refused with a logged
  "Unsupported condition", not silently dropped as if it matched NM.
- **Graded/unique copies are a second seller, not a second condition.**
  `gradedMarkers`, `isGraded`, `AddRelaxed` (so a genuine finish collision —
  a Foil-etched card's Near Mint and Near Mint Foil rows — doesn't refuse
  itself out) and `availableMarketNames`/`name2shorthand` (`Cool Stuff Inc`
  / `Cool Stuff Inc (unique)`, shorthands `CSI`/`CSIUnique`) all serve one
  fact: a single graded/unique copy sold on a printing's page is not that
  printing's market price, and pricing it as one prints a $500 slab as a
  card's going rate.
- **Bundles divide the price, not the quantity.** `bundleRe`/`bundledCopies`
  ("Buy 1 get 3 free!") divides the listed price by the bundle size; the
  displayed quantity is left as the stock figure the page shows (capped at
  "20+" like any other row), not scaled to match.

## The recurring shape: a promo shelf collides with a real one

Found three times, independently, in three different games — first on the
**buylist** path in each case, where it was fixed and shipped; the retail
path turned out to carry the identical live listings, unfixed, until the
measurement lower down in this section closed that gap too:

> A card is sold under CSI's catch-all `Promo` shelf, and the wording
> beside it — a note, a bracket in the name — names the *real* set or
> event it actually belongs to. The promo shelf holds its own printing at
> that same number, so if nothing reads the wording, the two meet: the real
> printing's price lands on the promo shelf's card instead.

- **One Piece** (#379): `onePieceShelf` — a Starter Deck reprint sits on
  `Promo` with `(Starter Deck 18)` in the name; `P-041` is both the plain
  promo and the deck card. Redirect to `"Starter Deck " + N`, but **only**
  when the shelf is exactly `"Promo"` — every other listing naming a deck
  already arrives on a real set, where the bracket names the deck the card
  was *reprinted from*, not where it lives now.
- **Pokemon** (#391): `pokemonPromoShelf` — the Pokemon Day 2025 Eevee sits
  on `Promo`... no, sits on `SV Prismatic Evolutions` at `074/131`, the
  same number as that set's own Eevee, told apart from it only by
  `RarityName == "Promo"`. Here the direction is reversed from One Piece:
  the fix *probes* `Edition: "Promo"` first and only takes it if that
  resolves; twenty of the fifty candidate rows name a printing no promo
  shelf holds at all (the Pokemon Rumble cards, holo promos that are
  genuinely their own set's foil) and must keep the shelf they arrived on.
- **Riftbound** (#393): `riftboundShelf` — the Nexus Night runes sit on
  `Promo` with the issuing set written at the head of the note
  (`"UNL-R05b"`, `"SFD-R05b"`); the promo shelf holds an Organized Play
  printing at that same number. Redirect to the set the note's prefix
  names, but **only** when that set actually holds the printing — Vendetta
  issued no b-lettered rune of its own, so its six listings correctly stay
  on `Promo`, which is where their printing really is.

Two of the three — `pokemonPromoShelf` and `riftboundShelf` — share the
same guard: *redirect only when the redirect target resolves*, verified
with an actual `mtgmatcher.Match` probe before committing to it.
`onePieceShelf` is looser: it redirects on the shelf-plus-bracket pattern
alone, with no resolve check, trusting that nothing else on the `Promo`
shelf ever carries a `(Starter Deck N)`-shaped bracket that isn't this
collision. That has held so far, but it is a real difference in rigor,
not just a simpler special case — if a fourth game needs this shape,
copy the probing version, not `onePieceShelf`'s.

All three are wired into `processSearch` (retail) as well as `parseBL`
(buylist) — confirmed as a live gap, not a hypothetical one, by fetching
each game's affected shelf live and replaying every row through the pre-
and post-fix resolution:

```
                          shelf                          compared  same  moved  gained  lost
One Piece                "Promo"                              220   213      7       0     0
Riftbound                "Promo"                               99    87     12       0     0
Pokemon                  "SV Prismatic Evolutions"             459   457      2       0     0
```

Every move landed on the correct printing — the same six Starter Deck
cards, the same twelve Nexus Night runes, and the Pokemon Day 2025 Eevee
*and* a Sylveon carrying the identical bracket that hadn't turned up in
the buylist capture. `pokemonPromoShelf` and `riftboundShelf` were
refactored to take primitive fields instead of `CSIPriceEntry` so both
paths could share one implementation; `onePieceShelf` needed no change,
since it already took primitives.

`nameQualifiers` remains buylist-only by design — One Piece's retail
`notes` field genuinely describes the artwork rather than the printing
(see "Per-game wording" below), which is a different, still-open question
from the shelf collision this section is about.

## Per-game wording, briefly

- **Magic**: two independent translation layers, not the game's own
  identifier — this game still has none in either feed. `preprocess.go`'s
  `Preprocess`/`preprocess` (retail) reconstructs set+number from the
  **image filename** when the wording alone won't resolve
  (`numFixes`, then a set-code/number split at length 3 and 4, then a
  letter-marked treatment split — `"TMCS0032"` is TMC #32's surge foil,
  where three or four raw characters read as no valid set/number pair at
  all); `PreprocessBuylist` instead trusts the buylist's own `Number`
  field first. Both funnel into `card2promo`, a large closed table of
  named promo printings the wording alone can't place (`card2promo` is a
  `switch cardName` — see AGENTS.md's "tables before code" on why this
  shape is a last resort, tolerated here only because the wording truly
  carries nothing else). `magicShelfFixups` is shared by both paths:
  emblems named "Emblem" with the planeswalker in the notes instead of the
  name, `"Duel Deck:"` singularized to the catalog's `"Duel Decks:"`,
  blank cards refused outright, and a `"NT Token"` note rewritten to
  `"N Token"`.
- **Pokemon**: `pokemonListing` is the single largest per-game function —
  about a dozen independent rewrites (Classic Collection reprints sold
  under Celebrations, "Special Metal Energy"→"Metal Energy" + Special
  variation, Imposter/Impostor Oak's Base-Set-only misspelling, Elite Four
  "Alakazam 4"→"Alakazam E4", prefixed energy/promo numbers like
  `MEE007`→set `MEE`, several literal misspellings, Non-Stamped/Illus.
  noise words stripped, a stamped promo redirected to the `Promo` shelf,
  Team Galactic invention names completed from their number, typed-energy
  letter spelling, and Nidoran's sex resolved by trying both). Layered on
  top: `firstEditionShelf`/`conditionRuns`/`matchRun` (a "1st Edition
  <Set>" *shelf name*, not a condition, is a whole other print run —
  refuse rather than silently answer with Unlimited), `pokemonNonHolo` (a
  `(Non-Holo)` bracket refused when the rarity says the card was never
  printed that way, and deliberately *not* refused the other direction — a
  holo bracket on a plain-rare row — because the catalog simply holding no
  nonfoil for a plain rare is a catalog gap rather than the storefront
  inventing a printing, and refusing those would drop real listings to
  catch nothing; see the function's own doc comment for the full
  reasoning), and `pokemonPromoShelf` above.
- **One Piece**: `nameQualifiers` (buylist-only — the retail note already
  describes the art, not the printing, so it's read raw instead),
  `onePieceEvents`/`eventNamed` (a closed table of storefront nicknames
  for a catalog event — "afro luffy promo", a playmat SKU, a participation
  pack — one entry per nickname, deliberately not generalized: a nickname
  names one product), `onePieceRenamedTreatment` (the Gear5 starter deck
  calls its premium printing "Full Art" where the catalog calls every
  premium printing in that set "Parallel" — the guard requires the word to
  name a real catalog label *somewhere*, the card's own set to hold no
  printing under that label already, and the set to carry exactly one
  premium label throughout, so a genuine Full Art set is never touched),
  `onePieceSpellings` (one entry, a dropped word), and `onePieceShelf`
  above.
- **Yu-Gi-Oh**: `catalogSpelling`/`csiSpellings` (nine hand-typos, kept as
  an exact table rather than nearest-match — 255 name pairs inside one set
  are a single edit apart, e.g. "Harpie Lady 1"/"2", so a distance-based
  corrector would silently answer a card the datastore is merely missing
  with its differently-numbered neighbour), `catalogColor`/`csiColors`
  ("(Light Blue)"→"(Silver)" for Duelist League prints, a *replace* not an
  *add* — the word "blue" on its own already names the blue printing, so
  leaving both would tie two printings where one used to resolve),
  `catalogRarity`/`csiRarities` (three foil-tier spelling differences),
  `printRunEdition`/`csiPrintRuns` (nine editions reprinted under their
  own original name, told apart only by the copyright date CSI writes into
  the note — deliberately left out of `mtgmatcher`'s own edition aliases
  for this exact reason), and `unknownPrinting`/`csiUnknownPrintings` (two
  hand-verified listings selling a rarity/number pair the catalog does not
  carry at all — refusing the general shape "rarity the card's number
  doesn't have" would drop 55 listings to catch these 2, and ~35 of the 55
  are legitimately-named decorated rarities).
- **Gundam**: `gundam.go`, one file, four problems — the shelf name
  carries a set-code prefix that narrows nothing (the same number repeats
  across GD01/its beta/the deck-build box) and is stripped
  (`gundamShelf`); the card's own name and the run's wording are split by
  the **position** of the collector-number parenthetical between them,
  not by bracket-counting, because a card's own name can itself end in a
  parenthetical (`gundamCard`); a handful of storefront misspellings
  (`gundamNames`, exact-keyed for the reason `csiSpellings` gives) and one
  symbol-name rewrite (`gundamSymbolWord`, "Xi (Symbol) Gundam" → the
  literal Greek letter); and the storefront's number spelling disagrees
  with the catalog's in three ways at once — a dropped digit, an extra
  zero, and a rarity letter suffixed onto a card number that carries none
  (`gundamNumberSpelling`).
- **Palworld**: `palworld.go`, one file, one problem — the storefront
  sometimes glues a rarity code onto the number's tail
  (`"EBP01-025RR"`), inconsistently even with itself (plain-spaced on one
  shelf, glued on another, and its own buylist writes every number clean).
  `palworldBaseRarities` is an *enumerated allow-list* of codes that are
  safe to split off, deliberately excluding the six rarities (OSR, SP, SR,
  SSP, TSP, TSR) the catalog numbers as printings of their own — splitting
  those apart would answer the base card for a parallel. A rarity code
  nobody here has heard of is left glued to the number rather than
  guessed at.
- **Lorcana**: no known collision shape yet. Both feeds pass name, edition
  and the raw note/number straight through to `mtgmatcher.Match` with no
  translation at all.

## Known gaps

- `pokemonPromoShelf`, `riftboundShelf`, and all of `pokemonListing` (and
  its dozen sub-rules) carry **no dedicated unit test** — nothing in
  `coolstuffinc/*_test.go` references either of the first two by name,
  even though each now has two call sites. `onePieceShelf` does
  (`oneshelf_test.go`); it's the odd one out among the three "recurring
  shape" functions for having no such gap.
- `GameDragonBallSuper` (`"dbs"`) and `GameStarWarsUnlimited` (`"swu"`) are
  shelf-name constants CSI itself uses, sitting unwired in this file —
  `mtgban.Game` has no constant for either game yet (`mtgban/mtgban.go`),
  so `csiGames` can't map them. Whoever adds either game to `mtgban`
  should check back here; the shelf name is already known.
- Sealed is wired in `cmd/bantool` for six of the eight singles-wired
  games — Gundam and Palworld have no `coolstuffinc_sealed_*` scraper
  option, though `NewScraperSealed` itself would accept either game (both
  are in `csiGames`).
- The `Black Bordered (foreign)` shelf resolves to `ErrUnsupported` on
  every listing it carries, in every language — see "Data sources" above
  for the specifics. Not a mispricing, just a silent, total coverage gap
  on a shelf CSI actively sells on.

## Environment

- `CSI_PARTNER` — optional affiliate id appended to every outbound link
  (`utm_referrer`). Not a credential; nothing here requires auth.
- Tests load a live datastore per game the same way every scraper package
  does — see `datastore_test.go`'s `withGameDatastore`/`readGameDatastore` —
  gated on `POKEMON_PATH`, `ONEPIECE_PATH`, `YUGIOH_PATH`, `PALWORLD_PATH`,
  and (for the one Magic-only image-filename test) `ALLPRINTINGS5_PATH`.
  CI runs `coolstuffinc/...` narrowly under the palworld, onepiece,
  yugioh, and pokemon jobs; the Magic-needing test is instead picked up by
  the Magic job's repo-wide `go test ./... -v`. No dedicated Lorcana,
  Riftbound, or Gundam test exists in this package today, so no CI job
  needs to run it for those three specifically — consistent with "Known
  gaps" above.
