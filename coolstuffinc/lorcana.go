// unpriced.
//
// The storefront's own catalog is what says it is a slip rather than a
// name: it files "Basil - Perspective Investigator" at 140/204 of Rise of
// the Floodborn, under its own image sku dl_RotFB_140, and that set's
// number 140 is "Basil - Perceptive Investigator". Everything but the one
// word agrees.
//
// Spelled out rather than found by nearest match, for the reason
// csiSpellings gives - and the more so here, where a name is a character
// and a title joined by a dash and the titles are the whole of what tells
// one printing of a character from another. This set alone sells Basil
// under three of them at consecutive numbers, 138 through 140.
